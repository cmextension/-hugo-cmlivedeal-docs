By using [CM Live Deal Categories module](/catmodule/) and [CM Live Deal Cities module](/cm-live-deal-cities-module/) you can have menus for categories and cities automatically.

But if you want to create menu items by yourself, for example to list the category for Christmas deals etc..., you can use `External URL` menu item type,

Create a new menu item, you click `Select` button of `Menu Item Type` option, in the popup you select `URL` in `System Links`.

After the popup is closed, you enter the URL of the city/category (or both) into `Link` field. Now when user clicks this menu item in your front-end, he/she is taken to the page where the deals in defined city/category (or both) are displayed.
