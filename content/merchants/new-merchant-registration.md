If in [CM Live Deal's Configuration](/configuration/merchant/), you set

*   `Merchant's user group` option to `Merchants` user group (create in [Configuration](/configuration/users-component/) section).
*   `Add merchant to group` option to `Add automatically after registration`.
*   `Block merchant` to `No`.

Then your new merchant is displayed in User -> User Manager similar to the screenshot below.
