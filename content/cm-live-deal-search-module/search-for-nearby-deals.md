By using CM Live Deal Search module, user can search for deals in all cities, in a specific city or deals near user.

To detect user's location, you can use GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from [http://www.maxmind.com](http://www.maxmind.com), or use HTML5 Geolocation service.

MaxMind service works on server side so it works in all browsers. HTML5 Geolocation works on client side, and not all browsers support HTML5 Geolocation, so dectecting user's location is not possible if user's browsers is not supported.
