The merchants in CM Live Deal component are actually Joomla! users that are in a specific user group.

In your back-end, you navigate to `Users` -> `Groups`.

You can see the list of current user groups on your site. Click `New` button in the toolbar to create a new user group.

You give your new user group a name by entering the name in `Group Title` field. You select a parent group in `Group Parent` option. Because merchant is just a registered user so you can select `Registered` as the parent group, you can always select a different group if you are already familiar with Jooma!'s user group and access level.
