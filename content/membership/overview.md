When you integrate with a third party membership Joomla! component, you can

*   earn money when merchant subscribes a new membership plan or upgrades subscribed plans
*   limit how many deals merchant can create
*   limit how may days merchant’s deals are displayed on your site

When the limitations are reached, if merchant wants to create more deals or extend the expired dates of merchant’s deals, merchant needs to upgrade to a higher membership plan.
