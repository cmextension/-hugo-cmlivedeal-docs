If the deal quantity of merchant's subscribed plan is unlimited (-1 value), then merchant can create unlimited deals on your site.

If it is limited by a specific value and merchant's deal quantity is smaller than this value, in merchant's deal management page there is a message similar to this:

However if merchant's deal quantity is equal to the limit value, New button is not displayed any more and merchant is asked to upgrade his/her membership:

In the above screenshot, by clicking “ugrade” link, merchant is taken to the menu item to upgrade the membership plan. You can select this menu item in the component's configuration.
