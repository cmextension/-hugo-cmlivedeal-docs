When merchant submits a new deal, administrator will review and approve the deal. The deal's starting date is only counted by the time when administrator approves the deal, not by the time merchant submits the deal.

For example, if merchant submits a deal at January 01, 2015 01:00:00, 12 hours later administrator approves the deal, then the deal's starting date is January 01, 2015 13:00:00. If the deal's length is 1 day then it will be unpublished at January 02, 2015 13:00:00.
