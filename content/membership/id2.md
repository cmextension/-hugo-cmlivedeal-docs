In Akeeba Subscription’s Custom Fields, you create the custom fields for website, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google+, phone and merchant’s about info. CMLiveDeal automatically takes Akeeba Subscription’s business name and address so you don’t need to create fields for merchant’s name and address.

Go to “Merchant” tab in CMLiveDeal’s configuration, set “Use subscriber’s profile as merchant’s profile” to “Enabled”. You enter the aliases (slugs) of the custom fields you create in Akeeba Subscription’s Custom Fields, you don’t need to enter values for “Field for business name” and “Field for address” fields.
