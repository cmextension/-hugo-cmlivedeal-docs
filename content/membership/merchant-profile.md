When merchant subscribes for his/her membership, the membership component asks merchant for basic information in the subscription form, you can get this information and put into merchantâ€™s profile.

If merchant renews his/her membership, the data in CMLiveDeal profile will not be modified unless it is empty, for example if merchant deletes the phone number in CMLiveDeal profile, he/she provides the phone number when renews the membership, then this new phone number will be automatically updated in CMLiveDeal profile and it will be displayed in the deals of this merchant.

Below is the instruction for setting this up in membership components.
