This information of a user has 2 values:

*   How many coupons the user captured (1)
*   How many coupons the user came to merchant and redeemed (2)

If (2) value is equal to (1) value, this means the user always comes to redeem the coupons that he/she captures on the site. This is a serious customer, if he/she is happy at the merchant’s place, there are many chances that he/she will come back.

If (1) value is much greater than (2) value, the merchant shouldn’t expect that the user will come to the merchant to redeem the current coupon.

Captured and Redeemed values are not available if the owner of the coupon is a guest.
